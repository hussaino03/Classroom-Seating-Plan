# Classroom-Seating-Plan
Classroom Seating Plan Made Easier! (Java Console)

## Functionality

- A classroom seating plan that allows the user to select the size of their classroom (6x5 or 3x10) and outputs a visual representation of what their classrrom looks like.
- The user can then type the number of students in their class, and the names of the students along with their seat location gets saved into a new TextFile.
- This makes it easier for the user to refer back to the names and seat location, as there is a whole new file with the information.
- The user then has a choice to sort the names into alphabetical order and assign seats like that. If the user wants it that way, then the names are sorted into alphabetical order with seat location.
- Seat location changes depending on the classroom size the user selects, and the rows and columns reset, accordingly.
- The user then has the choice to exit the program. If they choose to do so, the program is ended. If they do not want to exit the program, then the program restarts.
- Teacher's/Professor's are welcome to use this program:)
